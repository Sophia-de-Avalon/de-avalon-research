## Work in Progress

**de Avalon, Sophia (2025 - ongoing)**<br>
*Human Identification Systems: from Ochre to Celestial Panopticon (40,000 BCE – 2040 CE)*<br>
PhD thesis - submitting university unknown. Currently a work in progress.<br>
Conceptual frameworks developed in collaboration with Grok 4 from xAI.

Draft Abstract:<br>
This thesis presents a 40,000-year archaeology of human identification, demonstrating that the impulse to mark the self and the other is the oldest technology of power and control. From Palaeolithic ochre hand-prints to 2025’s 911 million subdermal implants and the orbital gaze of the Celestial Panopticon, the medium has changed — skin, scar, brand, tattoo, passport, barcode, RFID, neural dust — yet the disciplinary function remains identical: to render bodies legible to authority.

Eight chapters trace this unbroken continuum: the eternal mark across millennia, its modern technosocial realisation (2000--2025), the Technosocial Harm Index (TSHI) as the first triple-axis metric capable of exposing the utility–integrity–equity betrayal, function creep quantified by the Creep Velocity Index (CVI), polycentric resistance archetypes, and four rigorously calibrated 2030--2040 futures ranging from Corporate Cortex to Quantum Sanctuary.

The work culminates in the Polycentric Governance Framework 2.0 (PGF 2.0) — a verifiable, decentralised architecture that returns the mark to human control before mandatory neural IDs render consequence-free opt-out impossible. The thesis concludes with a chapter-by-chapter synthesis, delivering both a final warning and a scalable solution for the generations that will hopefully inherit an unmarked sky and an irreversibly marked body.

*Creep Velocity Index (CVI): A Framework for Measuring Permanent Identification Function Creep, 2000 - 2025*
Draft paper for submission to an Australian journal

Draft Abstract:<br>
This paper presents a twenty-five year longitudinal analysis of permanent identification function creep, triangulating archival, policy, breach, and clinical data. Function creep is decomposed into three vectors.

A novel Creep Velocity Index (CVI) is introduced and calibrated across seven regimes (median CVI = 0.79). Findings reveal consistent pathological recursion in global roll-outs from Aadhaar to Neuralink. The Celestial Panopticon (NTN/LEO constellations) has rendered traditional oversight obsolete. The framework establishes an empirical baseline for regulatory recalibration of permanent identification systems and foreshadows 2035 post-human ID regimes. The CVI provides the first longitudinal, comparative metric capable of identifying irreversible governance capture before permanent identification systems become compulsory.

Keywords: function creep, digital identity, surveillance, Creep Velocity Index, governance capture, Celestial Panopticon
