## Conceptual Frameworks

This page presents three conceptual, interactive frameworks. They are devloped to support scholarly discussion and interdisciplinary inquiry.
These frameworks are offered as analytical tools rather than prescriptive models, and are intended to be engaged with critically by researchers.

## 3. PCG 2.0 - Polycentric Governance Framework 2.0
The Governance Capture Loop describes the cybernetic pathology where regulators are captured by regulatees, attenuating variety until public servants 
become private enforcers and systems rigidify into domination. Inspired by Beer (1972), it maps revolving doors as "jobs for the boys" by cycling pharma 
executives to panels, intelligence officers to moderation boards, ensuring one narrative survives while dissent is labeled "threat." In COVID responses, 
this loop amplified industry-aligned stories, vindicated later by excess mortality data. The loop's closure violates Ashby's Law (Ashby 1956), turning tools of 
identification into weapons of exclusion. Countermeasures like transparency and decentralization break the cycle, restoring equilibrium before implosion.
