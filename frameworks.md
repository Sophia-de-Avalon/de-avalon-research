##Conceptual Frameworks

This page presents three conceptual, interactive frameworks. They are deeloped to support scholarly discussion and interdisciplinary inquiry.
These frameworks are offered as analytical tools rather than prescriptive models, and are intended to be engaged with critically by researchers.

## 1. TSHI - Technosocial Harm Index
The Technosocial Harm Index (TSHI) measures the human and social costs of hybrid identification systems, tracking exclusion rates, privacy erosion, 
consent illusions, and agency loss as voluntary tech creeps into compulsion. Complementing the CVI's velocity focus, TSHI quantifies damage: biometric 
failures denying services to millions (e.g., Aadhaar lockouts), health harms from microwave-linked implants, or silenced voices in captured narratives. 
Scaled 0–100, high TSHI warns of rising "excommunication" in digital societies, where non-participants face civic erasure. Drawing from 2003 SMHId 
insights on surveillance escalation, TSHI demands safeguards like opt-outs and decentralization to halt the harm before it becomes irreversible.

## 2. CVI - [Function] Creep Velocity Index
The Creep Velocity Index (CVI) quantifies the rate at which permanent identification systems expand from voluntary convenience to mandatory control, 
measuring unintended use-case growth (ΔU), population coverage (ΔP), and temporal velocity (t). Born from early warnings on subcutaneous microchips 
(SMHId, 2003), it formalizes the "creep" pattern: initial tools like animal tags evolving into human surveillance networks. With a formula CVI = ΔU / (ΔP × t), 
values above 0.8 signal pathological recursion, urging regulatory intervention. In regimes like India's Aadhaar or Australia's myID, high CVI reveals how 
"empowerment" hardens into exclusion, turning citizens into tenants in unaccountable systems.

## 3. PCG 2.0 - Polycentric Governance Framework 2.0
The Governance Capture Loop describes the cybernetic pathology where regulators are captured by regulatees, attenuating variety until public servants 
become private enforcers and systems rigidify into domination. Inspired by Beer (1972), it maps revolving doors—"jobs for the boys"—cycling pharma 
executives to panels, intelligence officers to moderation boards, ensuring one narrative survives while dissent is labeled "threat." In COVID responses, 
this loop amplified industry-aligned stories, vindicated later by excess mortality data. The loop's closure violates Ashby's Law, turning tools of 
identification into weapons of exclusion. Countermeasures like transparency and decentralization break the cycle, restoring equilibrium before implosion.
