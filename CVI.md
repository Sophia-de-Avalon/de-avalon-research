## CVI - [Function] Creep Velocity Index
The Creep Velocity Index (CVI) quantifies the rate at which permanent identification systems expand from voluntary convenience to mandatory control, 
measuring unintended use-case growth (ΔU), population coverage (ΔP), and temporal velocity (t). Born from early warnings on subcutaneous microchips 
(SMHId, 2003), it formalizes the "creep" pattern: initial tools like animal tags evolving into human surveillance networks. With a formula CVI = ΔU / (ΔP × t), 
values above 0.8 signal pathological recursion, urging regulatory intervention. In regimes like India's Aadhaar or Australia's myID, high CVI reveals how 
"empowerment" hardens into exclusion, turning citizens into tenants in unaccountable systems.
