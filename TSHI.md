## TSHI - Technosocial Harm Index

---

The Technosocial Harm Index (TSHI) measures the human and social costs of hybrid identification systems, tracking exclusion rates, privacy erosion, 
consent illusions, and agency loss as voluntary tech creeps into compulsion. Complementing the CVI's velocity focus, TSHI quantifies damage: biometric 
failures denying services to millions (e.g., Aadhaar lockouts), health harms from microwave-linked implants, or silenced voices in captured narratives. 
Scaled 0–100, high TSHI warns of rising "excommunication" in digital societies, where non-participants face civic erasure. Drawing from insights on 
surveillance escalation (SMHId, 2003), TSHI demands safeguards like opt-outs and decentralization to halt the harm before it becomes irreversible.
